# GlobalChallenges of the Global Supply Value Chain for Vaccines
The Global vaccine supply chain is confronted with many challenges such as counterfeiting, reporting inefficiencies, lack of transparency, and lack of real-time data, to mention a few. These challenges provide an opportunity to apply technology to solve these problems. With the use of blockchain technology, all the challenges listed can be mitigated or eradicated. I have listed some of the challenges below:
1.	Counterfeiting: There are numerous cases of counterfeit vaccine production all around the world, in many cases, these vaccines are administered to innocent and unsuspecting members of the public both young and old, and some of the consequences can be life-changing.

2.	Reporting inefficiencies:  Inefficiency occurs in the supply value chain when the system fails to deliver accurate, timely and accessible information when such information is required by any of the participating stakeholders. Delays in reporting can cause discrepancies leading to situations where vaccines may be delayed from reaching areas where they are needed

3.	Lack of real-time data: this is the inability of a system to provide up-to-the-minute information about present activities or changes, within a value chain, this problem can significantly hamper decision-making, coordination and efficiency, for example, a healthcare worker may decide it is more convenient to update stock levels only at the end of a shift resulting in several hours of delay in reporting the actual status of vaccine availability.

4.	Lack of Transparency: in the vaccine supply chain, lack of transparency refers to the absence of clear, accessible, and reliable information available to all stakeholders involved. When there’s insufficient visibility into the processes, operations, and data flows, it leads to confusion, mistrust, inefficiencies, and potential mismanagement. In the context of vaccine distribution, transparency is crucial for ensuring that vaccines are produced, distributed, and administered safely, equitably, and efficiently.  This will also boost the confidence of the various stakeholders in the supply chain.


Problems to be solved by the Decentralized Application

1.	Real-time Tracking: dApps can be integrated with IoT devices and APIs to automate the collection of real-time data from the supply chain. For instance, sensors in vaccine shipping containers can monitor temperature and location and automatically feed this data into the blockchain, ensuring real-time updates are available to all stakeholders, for example, if a shipment of vaccines is delayed or if there is a temperature fluctuation, the dApp can automatically log the event and trigger alerts to the appropriate parties, enabling them to take immediate corrective action.

2.	Immutable and Transparent data: All data stored on the blockchain is immutable and transparent, meaning that once real-time data is recorded, it can be accessed by all authorized participants in the supply chain. This increases trust and accountability, as stakeholders can independently verify the data at any time. For example: Governments, healthcare providers, and international organizations can track vaccine distribution in real time without having to rely on centralized databases, ensuring transparency.

3.	Standardized Reporting: A dApp operates on a decentralized blockchain, allowing all participants to access and update data in a standardized format. This eliminates the issue of siloed systems and ensures that real-time updates are consistently available to everyone, regardless of location or organization. For example, a healthcare facility in a remote location can report its vaccine inventory through this dApp, and this data will immediately be available to distribution centres and national health authorities, around the world, enabling better coordination.

4.	Smart Contracts for real-time alerts:  Smart contracts can be programmed to automatically trigger specific actions based on real-time data. For example, if a sensor detects that a vaccine shipment’s temperature has risen above the safe threshold, a smart contract can send an alert to the responsible parties and automatically flag the shipment for inspection, for example in cases of vaccine shortages, smart contracts could automatically reroute shipments from regions with surplus stock, ensuring that no time is wasted waiting for manual intervention.

5.	Reduced Human Error and Delays: By automating data collection and transmission, dApps remove the reliance on manual processes, which are prone to delays and errors. Real-time updates flow directly from the source (e.g., IoT devices, distributors, healthcare providers) to the blockchain, ensuring data is immediately available and accurate. For example: Instead of relying on healthcare workers to manually report vaccine usage, which can lead to delays, the dApp could automatically update vaccine inventory levels after each administration.



SMART CONTRACT FUNCTIONS

addVaccineBatchID():  This function is based on the assumption that each vaccine produced is assigned a unique batch id for easy tracking. This function is executed when the health facility receives the vaccine, this number is recorded on the blockchain, making it accessible to all relevant stakeholders.
Input parameter:

Batch ID: A unique identifier for the shipment.
The second function for my Dapp is 
Vaccine Administration (): This function is used when administering a vaccine to any recipient anywhere in the world.

The input parameters are:

i.batch id: This ID as earlier stated is unique for all vaccines produced around the world, such that no two vaccinees will have the same batch id.

ii. Patient Name: This is the name of the patient who the vaccine is administered on. This parameter will store the first name and last name. 

iii. administration date: This will record the date the vaccine was administered at the Health Facility.

iv Facility Name: This records the name of the Health Facility where the vaccine is administered.


In conclusion, the decentralized application (dApp) for the global supply of vaccines offers a transformative solution to critical challenges in vaccine distribution. By leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts, this dApp ensures real-time tracking, enhanced transparency, and accountability throughout the supply chain.  This application also provides stakeholders with the tool to monitor and maintain accurate inventories and prevent shortages. This system improves the overall efficiency of vaccine distribution while safeguarding against tampering, delays, and mismanagement, ensuring that vaccines reach those in need securely and on time.
